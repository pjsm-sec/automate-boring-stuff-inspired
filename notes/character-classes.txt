Shorthand Character Classes in Regular Expressions

* \d : Matches any digit from 0 to 9.
* \D : Matches any character that is not a digit (0-9).
* \w : Matches any letter (a-z, A-Z), digit (0-9), or underscore (_). 
* \W : Matches any character that is not a letter, digit, or underscore.
* \s : Matches any whitespace character, including spaces, tabs, and newlines.
        Consider this as matching “space-like” characters.
